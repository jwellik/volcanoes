Eruptions originated from a mantle plume through Devonian sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Two-thirds of the volcanic centers in the field are scoria cones; lava flows have been produced from about half of them. About 30% of the centers are maars or tuff rings, many of which are occupied by lakes. About 230 eruptions have occurred during the past 730,000 years.

The most prominent morphological feature of Etna is the Valle del Bove, a 5 x 10 km horseshoe-shaped caldera open to the east. Two styles of eruptive activity typically occur, sometimes simultaneously. Persistent explosive eruptions, sometimes with minor lava emissions, take place from one or more summit craters. Flank vents, typically with higher effusion rates, are less frequently active and originate from fissures that open progressively downward from near the summit (usually accompanied by Strombolian eruptions at the upper end). Cinder cones are commonly constructed over the vents of lower-flank lava flows. Lava flows extend to the foot of the volcano on all sides and have reached the sea over a broad area on the SE flank."

A small summit crater containing a cinder cone is breached to the NW and tops an older cone that is rimmed by the remnant of a larger crater. The basaltic-to-andesitic volcano has been active during historical time at both summit and flank vents, primarily along a NW-SE-trending fissure that cuts across the island, producing moderate explosive eruptions and lava flows that reached the coast. Historical eruptions at the 1413-m-high volcano date back to the mid-19th century. The island was evacuated following major eruptions in 1939 and 1960. The latter eruption, from a NW-flank fissure vent, produced a pyroclastic flow that swept to the sea and a lava flow that formed a new peninsula on the western coast."

262000,Krakatau,Caldera,2020,Indonesia,"The renowned volcano Krakatau (frequently misstated as Krakatoa) lies in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra. Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 or 535 CE, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan, and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan, and left only a remnant of Rakata. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java.  Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan.

The SE wall of the inner caldera lies beneath Lake Batur; Batur cone has been constructed within the inner caldera to a height above the outer caldera rim. The Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along the summit ridge. Historical eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity sometimes accompanied by lava emission. Basaltic lava flows from both summit and flank vents have reached the caldera floor and the shores of Lake Batur in historical time."

Mudflows were also recorded in 1743?, 1843 and 1909, possibly also associated with explosive activity.     "

Pleistocene deposits include plateau-capping lava flows, subglacial mounds and tuyas, and hyaloclastites.  Buck Hill Cone was erupted during the latest Pleistocene during the waning stages of the Fraser glaciation.  Holocene eruptions took place in the Spanish Creek, Ray Lake, and Kostal Lake areas (Hickson and Souther, 1984), forming cinder cones and producing lava flows that traveled up to 14 km.  A lava flow from Dragon cone is radiocarbon dated at about 7,600 years ago, and flows from Flourmill, Kostal, and Spanish Lake Cones rest on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, suggesting an early Holocene age.  The latest eruption took place from Kostal cone about 400 years ago (Hickson and Edwards, 2001).  "

Jefferson was constructed in two episodes interrupted by extensive glacial erosion. The first of these, beginning about 290,000 years ago, produced an andesitic-to-dacitic volcano possibly higher than the current summit. Dacitic lava domes were emplaced during a second cycle beginning about 70,000 years ago which included ash flows that traveled 15 km E and W. Several Holocene cinder cones near the Cascade crest south of Jefferson have produced lava flows that traveled down glacially carved valleys, including those from Forked Butte and North Cinder Peak. The most recent eruption, from a cinder cone on the flank of the South Cinder Peak cone, produced a lava flow that traveled west into Marion Lake about 1,000 years ago."

The oval-shaped crater extends from just below the summit to the lower flank, and was formed during a catastrophic eruption in 1902. The renowned Plinian eruption of 1902 that devastated much of SW Guatemala followed a long repose period after construction of the large basaltic-andesite stratovolcano. The massive dacitic Santiaguito lava-dome complex has been growing at the base of the 1902 crater since 1922. Compound dome growth at Santiaguito has occurred episodically from four vents, with activity progressing W towards the most recent, Caliente. Dome growth has been accompanied by almost continuous minor explosions, with periodic lava extrusion, larger explosions, pyroclastic flows, and lahars."

The summit of Tromen is cut by two overlapping 3.5-km-wide calderas. The Pleistocene Volcán Cerro Negro del Tromen, with a 5-km-wide caldera, lies immediately north, and lava flows have partially overtopped the northern caldera rim. At the SSW end of this N-S-trending chain is Cerro Tilhue, of Pleistocene-Holocene age. Post-caldera vents at Tromen were constructed inside both calderas and on the flanks of the NE-most caldera. The youngest lava flows originated from flank vents and descended the N and NE sides of the andesitic-to-rhyolitic volcanic complex. Holocene vents are also located in the Cerro Michico area on the lower NE flank. Historical eruptions were reported in the mid-18th century and in 1822. Von Wolff (1929) attributed purported eruptions of Pomahuida in 1820, 1823, 1827, 1828 as being from Tromen, but these are not confirmed."

The Huanquihué volcano group consists of a NNE-SSW-trending chain of stratovolcanoes of Pleistocene age, some of which lie along the border. A Holocene compound cinder cone with three nested craters up to 400 m in diameter that occupied a valley NE of Cerro Huanquihué and a tuff cone constructed within glacial Lake Epulafquen lies at the northern end of the chain. Growth of this Holocene tuff cone, La Angostura (""The Narrowing""), created a peninsula that formed a narrow channel connecting Lake Epulafquen and Lake Huechulafquen. A very recent lava flow from the base of the Achín-Niellu cinder cone (also known as Cerro Escorial) traveled north into glacial Lago Epulafquen, forming a prominent lava delta.  The Escorial lava flow is an extremely youthful flow that diverted local drainages and formed new  lakes.  A radiocarbon date of about 200 years before present was obtained from this flow, and local residents recount oral histories of the eruption, which was observed by their grandparents."

Largely glacier-covered, it contains a horseshoe-shaped ridge at the interior extending northward from the highest peak, 1100-m-high Mount Darnley. A steep-sided flank cone or lava dome, Havfruen Peak, is located on the east side, and a young crater and fissure are on the west flank.  Three large sea stacks lying off Turmoil Point at the western tip of the island may be remnants of an older now-eroded volcanic center. Both summit and flank vents have been active during historical time. The latest eruption, during 1956, originated from the west-flank crater, and deposited cinder over the icecap. The extensive icecap and the difficulty of landing make it the least explored of the South Sandwich Islands."
390081,Montagu Island,Shield,2007,United Kingdom,"The largest of the South Sandwich Islands, Montagu consists of a massive shield volcano cut by a 6-km-wide ice-filled summit caldera.

390090,Saunders,Stratovolcano,2021,United Kingdom,"Saunders Island is a volcanic structure consisting of a large central edifice intersected by two seamount chains, as shown by bathymetric mapping (Leat et al., 2013).
